# react-project-portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project is to share examples of work done and is a weekly challenge assignment given in the coding bootcamp that I'm enrolled in. The various projects featured use different technologies, and span from the beginning stages of bootcamp to present.

## User Story
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
